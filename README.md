# CODSOFT Repository

This repository is dedicated to the CodSoft Internship.

## Introduction

In this Git repository, I have uploaded the completed tasks assigned to me by Codsoft. These tasks are a part of my ongoing journey to improve my coding skills and contribute to the project's success. Each task has been carefully documented and organized to facilitate easy review and evaluation.

## Tasks

This repository contains the following tasks:

### Task 1: Portfolio

Creating a personal portfolio using CSS and HTML is a popular beginner web development project. Here are the key sections of the portfolio:

- **Header Section:** Add your name or a logo at the top. Optionally, include a brief introduction or tagline.
- **About Section:** Insert an image of yourself and write a short bio highlighting your skills and experience.
- **Skills Section:** List your key skills or areas of expertise.
- **Projects Section:** Showcase samples of your work or projects, including project titles, descriptions, and images.
- **Resume Section:** Provide a link to download your resume in PDF format.
- **Contact Section:** Include your contact information, such as email address and phone number.
- **Footer:** Add a copyright notice and any additional links or information.

### Task 2: To-Do List

Build a simple to-do list application that allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end and store the tasks in local storage or a simple backend server using technologies like Node.js or Flask.

### Task 3: Calculator

Create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Implement an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator should have a display screen to show user input and results. Utilize CSS grid system for button alignments. Use event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops to handle user input and perform calculations. This project requires some skill but can be done with basic knowledge of these technologies.

## Repository Structure

I have structured this repository to maintain a clean and structured directory hierarchy for each task, making it straightforward for anyone reviewing my work to navigate and assess the progress.
